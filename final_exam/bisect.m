function [root, it_count] = bisect(fcn, a0,b0,ep,max_iterate)
%
%
% This is the bisection method for solving an equation f(x)=0.
%
% The function f is given as a string. The function f is 
% to be continuous on the interval [a0,b0], and it is to be of 
% opposite signs at a0 and b0.  The quantity ep is the error 
% tolerance.  The routine guarantees this as an error bound 
% provided: (1) the restrictions on the initial interval are 
% correct, and (2) ep is not too small when the machine epsilon 
% is taken into account.  Most of these conditions are not 
% checked in the program!  The parameter max_iterate is an upper 
% limit on the number of iterates to be computed.
%
% For the given function f(x), an example of a calling sequence 
% might be the following:
%    root = bisect('sin(x)', 1,1.5,1.0E-6,10,1)
% The parameter index_f specifies the function to be used.
%
% The following will print out for each iteration the values of
%      count, a, b, c, f(c), (b-a)/2
% with c the current iterate and (b-a)/2 the error bound for c.
% The variable count is the index of the current interate.  Tap 
% the carriage return to continue with the iteration.
